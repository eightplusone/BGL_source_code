Peter Kok:
Each day contains eight records: middle of the night, before breakfast, after breakfast, before lunch, after lunch, before dinner, after dinner and before bed time. Each record is printed on one line and contains a number of variables, separated by semicolons, each of which may or may not have a value. These variables are: date, time, blood glucose, short acting insulin (novorapid), long acting insulin (lantus), meal carbohydrates, exercise (scale of 1-5, with 1=no exercise and 5=heavy exercise), stress (scale of 1-5, with 1=no stress and 5=lot of stress). Exercise and stress cover the interval following the record; they are only recorded for the main records (nrs. 2, 4, 6 and 8). I trained the system using the blood glucose values at these main records.
